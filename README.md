An application in production, you must not have any log statements. To enable your logs statements calls only during development phase, 
Android offers you the BuildConfig.DEBUG property. This flag is set automatically to false when an application if deployed into an APK 
for production and then, itâ€™s set to true during development.

To use it, you must write your log statements like that :

if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    Log.d(TAG + "message");
}
